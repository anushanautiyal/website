      Welcome to the Golden Gate Bridge! The Bridge connects San Francisco to California's northern counties. With its tremendous 746-foot tall towers, sweeping main cables, signature International Orange color, and Art Deco styling, it is a sensory experience featuring color, light, and sound. With more than 10 million annual visitors, be ready for crowds (especially during the summer) and changing weather conditions. </p>

    <p> 
      The all new visitor experiences are centered around an all new Bridge Plaza at the south east end. The visitor experience was recently renovated and renewed by our non-profit partner, the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, as their gift to the Golden Gate Bridge in honor if its 75th anniversary which was celebrated on May 27, 2012.
